### *Learning to herd Coxeter diagrams in the Hyperbolic Plains since 2021*
### *Vinny is now working the fields (slowly)*

### Howto

Assuming you have julia installed, it should go like this:

First, clone the repo:

> git clone https://github.com/bottine/VinbergsAlgorithmNF

Move to the folder:

> cd VinbergsAlgorithmNF

Launch julia:

> julia

From julia, activate the environment (whatever that means):

> using Pkg; Pkg.activate(".")

This should install whatever is necessary.
Then

> using Hecke
> using VinbergsAlgorithmNF; VA = VinbergsAlgorithmNF

And now one can try to run the algo (staying in the julia REPL):
E.g, to run 

#### the small example from Belolipetsky survey:

> K,a = Hecke.quadratic_field(5) # a is -√5
> ϕ = (a-1)//2
> Bel = [2 -1 0 0; -1 2  -ϕ 0; 0 -ϕ 2 -1; 0 0 -1 2]
> vd = VA.VinbergData(K,Bel)
> (status, (roots,dict,das)) = VA.next_n_roots!(vd,n=10)

Now `status` tells whether the roots found form a finite volume diagram, `roots` is the roots found and `dict,das` are internal structures used for the iteration.

**Normally**, calling `show(das)` in jupyter or the like should show the Coxeter diagram defined by the roots.

To continue running the algorithm where we stopped (which is not necessary here, since there are less than 10 roots), call

> (status, (roots,dict,das) = VA.next_n_roots!(vd,roots,dict,das,n=10)

#### On ℚ

To use ℚ as the field of definition, we need to let

> K,a = Hecke.rationals_as_number_field()
