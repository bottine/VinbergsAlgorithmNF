## Theory

Fixed throughout are:
* a **totally real** number field ``K``, and a chosen embedding of ``K`` in ``ℝ``; 
* with ring of algebraic integers ``R ≔ 𝒪_K`` assumed to be a **PID**;
* a  ``(n+1)×(n+1)`` matrix ``Q`` with entries in ``R`` with:
  * ``Q`` of signature ``(n,1)``,
  * each of its non-trivial Galois conjugates of signature ``(n+1,0)`` (positive definite);
* ``L ≔ R^{n+1}`` and ``V ≔ L⊗ℝ``.
* ``q`` the bilinear form on ``L`` and ``V`` defined by ``Q`` (we use the shortcut notation ``x y ≔ q(x,y) ≡ x'Qy`` where ``'`` means the transpose); 
* ``ℍ^n`` either connected component of ``\{x∈V: x²=-1\}``; 
* ``𝒪'`` the isometry group of ``(V,q)``, and ``𝒪`` its index 2 subgroup preserving ``ℍ^n``.
* ``Γ≔𝒪^L`` the subgroup of ``𝒪`` preserving ``L``.
* ``Γ_r≔𝒪^L_r`` the subgroup of ``𝒪^L`` generated by hyperbolic reflections.

In [Hecke](https://github.com/thofma/Hecke.jl), a number field has no chosen embedding into ``ℝ`` (or ``ℂ``), but `infinite_places(::AnticNumberField)` yields the list of possible embeddings, and we choose the first, always, by convention.
